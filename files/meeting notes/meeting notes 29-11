3 deliverables:
-code
-report
-video

deadline: 22-12-23

graph ideas:
interaction: overlay radar charts
-> two selectors (one for each song)
-> put some statistics next to it?
-> maybe also pre-selector in which you can choose song or artist and then artists can also be compared

heatmap: correlation matrix (all relevant features)
-> selector with genre (or other features)
scatterplot matrix instead of heatmap
-> interaction with selection/zoom box 

1. What are the distinguishing audio feature profiles between songs with high Spotify streams and those with high YouTube views/engagement?
-> 2 radar charts with music features weighted with popularity streams/views
-> maybe third with combined spotify+yt
-> other view: PCP chart (or additional audio features on the chart)

2. What is the correlation between different audio features?
-> heatmap or SPLOM
-> selector genre maybe
-> maybe option to weight it
